# BRAVO

Our project, BRAVO, provides interactive visualizations that capture the essence of these experiments, allowing scientists to quickly grasp the data's structure. We also integrated additional open science datasets from NASAâ€™s Open Science Data Repository to enrich the insights. We built a responsive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly to present these complex datasets effectively.
